## Start
Follow lesson 1 and lesson 2 from fastai depp learning 2019 course from [here](https://course.fast.ai/).
Download this repository and open vehical_classification.ipynb file in google colab

[Follow this steps to configure colab](https://course.fast.ai/start_colab.html)

first you need to set your storage. In my case i used google drive which is set in first line of code in notebook.

after setting storage run all cell one by one and understand what's going on.

while downloading dataset from browser after pasting javascript code in browser console, if download popup is not start check you have any popup blocker running in your browser. If you are running popup blocker then disable and run javascript code again.(In my case i disabled adblock plus extension for download dataset)
